A free, open-source, personal finance calculator based on finance theory and machine learning. 

### How to use
The project is currently in progress. As of right now, it's a terminal input program. Clone the repo, delete the saved financial info object, and run 'python main.py' to register your financial information (this creates a file that's saved automatically to your directory). Then, run 'python main.py' again to generate the financial plan. Later, this project will be turned into a website. 

### Development Path
1. Completely build out the base application so a user can create a financial plan, start to finish, with minimal friction.
2. Turn the application from a terminal application into a website using Django and host it.
    - Account creation so users can save their info. 
3. (Optional) add ML/AI features, like advanced stock picking and a ChatGPT API integration to answer questions about the financial plan.
